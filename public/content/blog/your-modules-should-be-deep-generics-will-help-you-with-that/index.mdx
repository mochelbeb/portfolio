First, what is meaning of a deep module? the term "Deep Module" is used by John Ousterhout in his book [_A Philosophy of Software Design_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39996759-a-philosophy-of-software-design):

> The best modules are those that provide powerful functionality yet have simple interfaces. I use the term deep to describe such modules.
>
> The best modules are deep: they have a lot of functionality hidden behind a simple interface. A deep module is a good abstraction because only a small fraction of its internal complexity is visible to its users.

A good example of this is MUI's [Autocomplete](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/) component, the most basic usage of it is quite simple:

```tsx
<Autocomplete
  options={top100Films}
  value={film}
  onChange={setFilm}
  renderInput={(params) => <TextField {...params} label="Movie" />}
/>
```

You probably should create your own `Autocomplete` wrapper component so you don't have to specify `renderInput` on every call,
but still, the interface is quite simple, even though the capabilities of this component are quite huge and versatile (you can give [the documentation page](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/) a quick read to see what it supports).

so where does Generics help? Say you want to support multiple selection, you can use [`multiple`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/#multiple-values) prop for this:

```tsx {6}
<Autocomplete
  options={top100Films}
  value={film}
  onChange={setFilm}
  renderInput={(params) => <TextField {...params} label="Movie" />}
  multiple
/>
```

You will get the following type error:

```log
Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'string[]'.
```

this won't be possible to do without Generics (this specific case is also possible to do with [discrimination unions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html#discriminating-unions)),
the idea is, you would like to have a simple interface, while also supporting all use cases with minimum **cognitive load**,
your interface should help its users to provide all correct parameters without them needing to remember all details about the interface,
and that's what Generics will help us with.

## How Generics Help You Design Simple Interfaces

To drive this home, what would this interface looks like without generics, I can think of two options:

- Create another component, called `MultiAutocomplete` which only accepts array `value`, but now say you want to also have [`freeSolo`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/#free-solo) so you have to create `FreeSoloMultiAutocomplete`.... you get the idea.
- Don't bother with typing this and provide the value type as `string | string[]`, and you can see how complex the interface will become.

With generics, by providing `multipe={true}`, it will reflect on other props, requiring the user to provide arrays for `value` prop, I find this interface to be a good example of advanced generic usage, simple yet powerful, we will try to re-implement this interface, bit by bit.

## Re-implementing AutocompleteProps

before we start the implementation, let's look at the library's generic signature:

```tsx
export interface AutocompleteProps<
  Value,
  Multiple extends boolean | undefined,
  DisableClearable extends boolean | undefined,
  FreeSolo extends boolean | undefined,
  ChipComponent extends React.ElementType = ChipTypeMap['defaultComponent'],
>
```

We can skip `ChipComponent` as we can't easily see how it will change the interface, let's go through each parameter one by one, we will also only observe their effects on `options` and `value` props for brevity.

### Value

the autocomplete value can be anything, so we won't use [generic constraints (`extends`)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html#generic-constraints) for the `Value` parameter:

```ts
interface AutocompleteProps<Value> {
  options: ReadonlyArray<Value>;
  value?: Value | null;
}
```

> `ReadonlyArray` is needed so our component can accept [`readonly`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-func.html#readonly-and-const) options.

### Multiple

If `true`, `value` must be an array and the menu will support multiple selections. the value of this parameter matches `multiple` prop:

```ts {4}
interface AutocompleteProps<Value, Multiple extends boolean | undefined> {
  options: ReadonlyArray<Value>;
  value?: Value | null;
  multiple?: Multiple;
}
```

Now, if `multiple={true}` then `value` should be an array, to achieve this we need [Conditional Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html):

```ts {3}
interface AutocompleteProps<Value, Multiple extends boolean | undefined> {
  options: ReadonlyArray<Value>;
  value?: Multiple extends true ? Array<Value> : Value | null;
  multiple?: Multiple;
}
```

### DisableClearable

If `true`, the input can't be cleared (can't be null). similarly to `Multiple` conditional type:

```ts {9-11,13}
interface AutocompleteProps<
  Value,
  Multiple extends boolean | undefined,
  DisableClearable extends boolean | undefined,
> {
  options: ReadonlyArray<Value>;
  value?: Multiple extends true
    ? Value[]
    : DisableClearable extends true
      ? NonNullable<Value>
      : Value | null;
  multiple?: Multiple;
  disableClearable?: DisableClearable;
}
```

### FreeSolo

If true, the user input is not bounded to the provided options and the user can type in anything,
thus the type will become `Value | string`, how can we do this conditionally? it's possible to do it this way:

```ts
FreeSolo extends true ? Value | string : Value
```

Integrating with the interface:

```ts {9, 11, 12}
interface AutocompleteProps<
  Value,
  Multiple extends boolean | undefined,
  DisableClearable extends boolean | undefined,
  FreeSolo extends boolean | undefined,
> {
  options: ReadonlyArray<Value>;
  value?: Multiple extends true
    ? Array<FreeSolo extends true ? Value | string : Value>
    : DisableClearable extends true
      ? NonNullable<FreeSolo extends true ? Value | string : Value>
      : (FreeSolo extends true ? Value | string : Value) | null;
  multiple?: Multiple;
  disableClearable?: DisableClearable;
  freeSolo?: FreeSolo;
}
```

Okay this doesn't look good, we probably should take `FreeSolo` condition to a separated utility type, a quick refresher:
`Type | never` is the same as `Type`, we can make use of this:

```ts {11, 13, 14}
export type AutocompleteFreeSoloValueMapping<FreeSolo> =
 FreeSolo extends true ? string : never;

interface AutocompleteProps<
  Value,
  Multiple extends boolean | undefined,
  DisableClearable extends boolean | undefined,
  FreeSolo extends boolean | undefined,
> {
  options: ReadonlyArray<Value>;
  value?: Multiple extends true
    ? Array<Value | AutocompleteFreeSoloValueMapping<FreeSolo>>
    : DisableClearable extends true
      ? NonNullable<Value | AutocompleteFreeSoloValueMapping<FreeSolo>>
      : Value | AutocompleteFreeSoloValueMapping<FreeSolo> | null;
  multiple?: Multiple;
  disableClearable?: DisableClearable;
  freeSolo?: FreeSolo;
}
```

a little bit better now... okay, it still looks pretty complex (nested ternaries are always hard to read) but again,
this is something that's hidden inside your component,
your users won't ever see this. It's part of the "internal complexity" that deep modules hides.

### Tying It all Together

```ts
export type AutocompleteFreeSoloValueMapping<FreeSolo> =
 FreeSolo extends true ? string : never;
interface AutocompleteProps<
  Value,
  Multiple extends boolean | undefined,
  DisableClearable extends boolean | undefined,
  FreeSolo extends boolean | undefined,
> {
  options: ReadonlyArray<Value>;
  value?: Multiple extends true
    ? Array<Value | AutocompleteFreeSoloValueMapping<FreeSolo>>
    : DisableClearable extends true
      ? NonNullable<Value | AutocompleteFreeSoloValueMapping<FreeSolo>>
      : Value | AutocompleteFreeSoloValueMapping<FreeSolo> | null;
  multiple?: Multiple;
  disableClearable?: DisableClearable;
  freeSolo?: FreeSolo;
}

function Autocomplete<
  Value,
  Multiple extends boolean | undefined = false,
  DisableClearable extends boolean | undefined = false,
  FreeSolo extends boolean | undefined = false,
>({}: AutocompleteProps<Value, Multiple, DisableClearable, FreeSolo>) {
  // ...
}
```

You can play around with the `Autocomplete` and see how it reflects the correct `value` type for each boolean prop

**NOTE**

You can notice that we're using `false` as a default value (`undefined` also works)

```ts {3-5}
function Autocomplete<
  Value,
  Multiple extends boolean | undefined = false,
  DisableClearable extends boolean | undefined = false,
  FreeSolo extends boolean | undefined = false,
({}: AutocompleteProps<Value, Multiple, DisableClearable, FreeSolo) {
// ...
}
```

This is needed because the generic parameters cannot be inferred if the props that they depend on are not defined,
it will only work if you pass `false` or `undefined` explicitly:

```tsx
<Autocomplete multiple={false} />
```

This why the default values are needed.

## Deep Modules and Generics

Your module can be a component, a class, or even an utility function,
you should always try to hide complexity and only ask your users for the minimum amount of parameters,
while still allowing advanced usage if needed.

Generics can help you reduce the cognitive load that your users may have in their attempt to provide valid parameters for advanced module usage,
all without even running the code. It may seems like a waste of time just writing a type this complex,
but if you're implementing something that is supposed to be used extensively and it needs to support multiple use-cases,
then it may worth doing this investment, and I also claim that it can help you think more thoroughly about your module interface design
(props in the case of components) and as a result design better interfaces.

If you're interested, you can see the full type implementation for `AutocompleteProps` in [mui/material-ui](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/master/packages/mui-material/src/Autocomplete/Autocomplete.d.ts) Github repository.
