## About

HumyApp is a full food delivery service, which has been uploaded to Google play and has over 10k users.

- The Customer Application: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nbs.alphameal&hl=en&gl=US)

### Admin Dashboard

I worked in the front-end team on building the admin dashboard.

- Complex forms with a lot of validations.
- CRUD operations to manage all the applications (Customer, Pioneer and Driver).
- Permission-based authorization system.
