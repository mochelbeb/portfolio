## About

Golden Panel is a modern full-stack web application designed for gold store management. It enables businesses to track sales, purchases, and inventory while ensuring secure user authentication and role-based access control.

### Development & Responsibilities

As a Full-Stack Developer for Golden Panel, I have been responsible for designing and developing the application, ensuring seamless integration of the frontend and backend. My responsibilities include:

- Implementing secure user authentication and role-based access control with Django.
- Managing client and transaction data efficiently using Supabaseâ€™s PostgreSQL database.
- Building systems for tracking sales and purchases, including complex price calculations and inventory management.
- Designing an intuitive interface using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components.
- Integrating barcode generation and NFC scanning for inventory and client verification.
- Applying caching strategies and using Zustand for efficient state management.

- Designing and developing the app's user interface, database integration, and notification system.
- Writing clean, efficient code following best practices.
- Using Flutter to build the app as a cross-platform mobile application.
