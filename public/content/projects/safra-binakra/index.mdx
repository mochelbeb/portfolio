## About

The main objective of the platform is to centralize the management of operations and automate the booking processes. I was responsible for building the admin dashboard and the user application.

### User Application

- The ability to view and visualize trips based on their status, whether they are upcoming, ongoing, or completed.
- Notification service for general announcements and updates about trips.
- Booking seats in a trip in realtime.
- Responsive. Can work on any device.
- Behaves as a native application (PWA).
