## About

Route DZ is a collaborative platform designed to improve road infrastructure in Algeria. It features a mobile application developed with Flutter, allowing users to report issues and provide feedback on road conditions. Complementing this, an admin panel built with React offers management and oversight capabilities. The backend is powered by Express.js and MongoDB, ensuring efficient data processing, while Firebase supports cloud services for real-time updates and scalability. This full-stack solution fosters community engagement and streamlines efforts to enhance road safety and maintenance.

### Development & Responsibilities

I worked as a Front-End & Mobile Developer from 2022 to 2023, leading the design and implementation of the application. My responsibilities included:

- Designing and developing the app's user interface, database integration, and notification system.
- Writing clean, efficient code following best practices.
- Using Flutter to build the app as a cross-platform mobile application.

### Admin Dashboard

I also contributed to the admin dashboard development.

- Complex forms with a lot of validations.
- CRUD operations to manage all the applications (Passenger, Driver, and Operator).
- Permission-based authorization system.
